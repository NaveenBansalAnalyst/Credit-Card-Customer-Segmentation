# Credit-Card-Customer-Segmentation
We are given a dataset that contains information about a credit card company's customers and we are asked to help segment them into different groups in order to apply different business strategy for each type of customer.

For instance, the company could provide higher credit limits for customers that use the card a lot, but spend little money, or even create incentives for those with high income who don't use the card as much as the company expects. In order to apply different strategies, the company needs different groups of customers.

It is decided that we will use K-means algorithm to segment the customers.

In order to use the algorithm properly and achieve all the goals that the company has set for us, we'll go through the following steps:

* Analyze the dataset;
* Prepare the data for modeling;
* Find an appropriate number of clusters;
* Segment the data;
* Interpret and explain the results.
